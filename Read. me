# 🧠 Symptom-Based Disease Classification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for a **multi-class disease prediction system** based on patient symptom data.  
The project applies supervised machine learning to predict 42 possible diseases using 132 symptom features, supporting early clinical triage and computational diagnostics.

## 📘 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict disease outcomes from symptom patterns and identify key features contributing to model decisions.  
- **Dataset:** Public Kaggle dataset — [Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning).  
- **Records:** 4,900 patients × 132 binary symptom features + 1 target (disease label).  
- **Target:** 42 possible diseases (multi-class classification).

## 🧬 Research Question

> Can machine learning accurately classify diseases using only symptom-based features, and which symptoms most strongly influence those predictions?

---

## 🧩 Methods & Workflow

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Loaded dataset (`Training 2.csv`)  
- Dropped empty columns (e.g., `Unnamed: 133`)  
- Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent")`  
- Encoded target labels using `LabelEncoder`  
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`  
- Split data using **Stratified 80/20 Train–Test** split

### **2. Models Implemented**
| Model | Description | Accuracy | Macro F1 |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | Multinomial baseline classifier | 0.98 | 0.97 |
| Random Forest | Ensemble model for non-linear patterns | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | Distance-based pattern learner | 0.94 | 0.92 |

### **3. Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy  
- Macro F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrices  
- Feature Importance (Random Forest)

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Random Forest** achieved perfect accuracy, indicating strong relationships among symptom features.  
- **Top predictive symptoms** include: *muscle pain, itching, yellowing of eyes, family history,* and *fatigue*.  
- Linear and non-linear models both perform well, confirming dataset quality and informative features.  
- The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning for interpretable, symptom-based disease triage.

## 🔍 Next Steps
- Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and KNN  
- Integrate **XGBoost** for boosted-tree comparison  
- Add **SHAP** or permutation-based interpretability methods  
- Validate results on larger or external medical datasets
